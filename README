Raspberry Pi Sensor Box README
=============

This programm runs, as the name already implies, on a Raspberry Pi.
Its purpose is to read pressure sensors and send the results to
the XCSoar program via TCP port 4353.
The serial port of the Raspberry can be connected to a Flarm or a logger.
The data from this serial port is send to XCSoar TCP port 4352, the
data transfer is bidirectional and should support IGC download from Flarm
from XCSOar version 6.8.

An AHRS using the MPU9150 is implemented, however it is not yet functional (Feb 2014).

The program is compiled on the Raspberry under Raspbian.
