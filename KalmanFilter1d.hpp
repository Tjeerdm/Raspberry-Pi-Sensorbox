 * A Kalman filter that estimates a one-dimensional quantity "x" and
 * its rate of change. Observations are of the one-dimensional
 * quantity itself. Rate of change is assumed to be perturbed by
 * Gaussian noise with a configurable variance. There are assumed to
 * be no control inputs.
 *
 * The notation, arithmetic, and the model itself borrow from the "truck"
 * example on this version of the Wikipedia page for Kalman filters:
 *   http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kalman_filter&oldid=484054295
 * This implementation is devised from public domain code available here:
